# Multiclass Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on multiclass classification using a dataset containing various body performance metrics and health factors. The primary goal is to predict a person's performance grade based on the provided data. The performance grades are categorized into four classes: A, B, C, and D, with A representing the best performance and D representing the worst.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of the following features:\
[age, gender, height , weight, body fat %, diastolic, systolic, gripforce, sit and bend forward, sit ups, broad jump]\
Each data point is labeled with one of the four performance grades (A, B, C, or D).

## Classification Algorithms

Logistic Regression\
Decision Tree\
Random Forest\
Gradient Boosting\
AdaBoost\
K-Nearest Neighbors

## Evaluation Metrics

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for each class\
ROC score


## Future Improvements

This project is a starting point for multiclass classification on performance metrics. Future improvements and enhancements could include:
Hyperparameter tuning for better model performance.\
Exploring different feature engineering techniques.\
Implementing ensemble methods for combining multiple models.
